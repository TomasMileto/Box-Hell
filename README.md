# Box-Hell
Survival arcade 2.5D game

Box Hell is a survival arcade game I made for the first project of my game dev course. 
Despite being the first of the two I devoloped for that course, I find this one to be the most fun.


## What I Learned

• The basics of the Unity Editor\
• Game Managers, UI Managers, Instances and Singletons\
• Usage of the Unity Inspector\
• Basic Animations, sprites and Animator\
• Movement and colliders\
• Instantiate and Destroy (for shooting and mobs)\
• Playability\
• Inputs, Mouse Position and simple Raycasts\
