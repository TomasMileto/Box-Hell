# Box-Hell
Survival arcade 2.5D game

Box Hell is a survival arcade game I made for the first project of my game dev course. 
Despite being the first of the two I devoloped for that course, I find this one to be the most fun.


## What I Learned

• The basics of the Unity Editor\
• Game Managers, UI Managers, Instances and Singletons\
• Usage of the Unity Inspector\
• Basic Animations, sprites and Animator\
• Movement and colliders\
• Instantiate and Destroy (for shooting and mobs)\
• Playability\
• Inputs, Mouse Position and simple Raycasts\
• Audio and Camera treatment\
• Basic Particles Systems\
• 2D and 3D vectors\
• How to Build the project\
• How to host and implement a simple leaderbord (this one was an extra)

PD: The music and majority of the sounds where made by me using BoscaCoil (actually not recommended, gave me a lot of troubles with my second project)

## What I intend to do whit this project

• Support joystick input\
• Implement two player mode\
• Add hazards, random weapons, more power-ups and perhaps bosses\
• Refine code (it's kinda uncouth)\
• SKINS\
• An actual clear how-to-play
